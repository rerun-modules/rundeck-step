You've created an awesome new rerun command that is
flexible and environment independent because of 
the options you've defined for it.

How do you share your command as an automation building block to 
people writing process automation jobs?
Expose your command as a [Rundeck](http://rundeck.org) job step!

Use *job-step* to generate a Job definition that maps each of
your rerun commands as job options.

Use *node-step-plugin* to generate a Rundeck step plugin.
