Use *job-step* to call your rerun command as a single step job.

Example
-------

Say you have a command, "waitfor:process", that checks for a system process  
and you would like to call it from a Rundeck job.

Let's say waitfor:process defines the following command options: 

    $ rerun waitfor
    ping: "wait for process"
       --name <>: "the process name"
      [ --interval <30>]: "seconds between checks"

The `--name <>` option is required while the `--interval` option is not
since it has a default value, 30.

Run `rundeck-plugin:job-step` to generate a job definition.

    rerun rundeck-plugin:job-step --module waitfor --command process

The "job.yaml" produced can be loaded to your rundeck project.
Here is the content of the job.yaml for this example:

	# Generated by rundeck-step:job-step.
	- name: waitfor:ping
	  description: 'wait for ping response from host'
	  group:
	  loglevel: INFO
	  sequence:
	    keepgoing: false
	    strategy: node-first
	    commands:
	    - exec: rerun waitfor:ping --host "${option.host}" --interval "${option.interval}"
	  options:
	    host:
	      description: the host to reach
	      required: true
	    interval:
	      description: seconds between checks
	      required: true
	      value: '30'
